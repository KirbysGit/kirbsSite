# Whats up!! Welcome to the code behind my site! 👋

Check it out live: **[colinkirby.dev](https://colinkirby.dev)**

## What's this?

This started as me just messing around with frontend learning, but I decided I wanted to make a portfolio, so I incorporated some of those messy components into one cohesive site. The whole thing flows as a gradient downwards from space to underwater - because why not?

## Site Breakdown

- **Hero** - Cool animated entrance to set the vibe
- **WhoIAm** - A little breakdown of my background
- **Experience** - My work experiences, from serving to software
- **Projects** - Some of what I've built
- **About** - Some more info about me

That's it! Simple, friendly, and hopefully a bit fun to explore.

## Future Additions

I really want to incorporate some 3D aspects into the site. I've taken a lot of inspiration from other SWEs online, mainly from other students I'm connected with on LinkedIn from UCF.

I'm thinking about adding an interactive 3D experience where viewers can explore a little town - each building would represent a different aspect of my career or life. Think of it like a game where you wander through my resume in 3D.

That's definitely a bit down the road though. For now I'll probably put some time into my SentimentTrader project.
