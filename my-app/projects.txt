Projects : 

ShelfVision – Deep Learning-Based Retail Shelf Detection System - https://github.com/KirbysGit/I2DLproj
• Designed and implemented ShelfVision, a full-stack custom object detection architecture tailored for dense retail shelf environments, leveraging PyTorch, Torchvision, ResNet-50, Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), and OpenCV.
• Engineered dynamic anchor-to-ground truth matching, robust multi-scale training pipelines, and extensive visualization-driven debugging tools (anchor spread plots, loss curves, prediction overlays) to stabilize model training after initial baseline collapse (0 mAP → 0.0069 mAP).
• Benchmarked ShelfVision against YOLOv5 on SKU-110K, demonstrating superior object localization, early-stage generalization, and resilience to dense object scenes despite constrained training resources.
• Led all core model development efforts, including architecture design, anchor tuning, matching logic improvements, loss reweighting, training stabilization, post-processing optimization, and modular evaluation pipeline creation.
